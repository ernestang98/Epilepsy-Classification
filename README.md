# Epilepsy_Classification_Project
Epilepsy is recognised as a major medical and social problem in Singapore. With a life-time prevalence of 3.8 per 1000, this project aims to identify if a person is having a seizure or not based on a sample of his EEG readings. A given set of EEG readings was analysed with python using the various data analysis and machine learning libraries.
